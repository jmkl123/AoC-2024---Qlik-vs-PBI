//Import
Input:
LOAD

    @2 as ValueB
FROM [lib://AoC/Day1/Input1.txt]
(txt, utf8, no labels, delimiter is spaces, msq); //Lesson Learned: You can not use Order By for csv/txt.



//Sort Data and match it
SortedData:
load
	rowno() as Position,
    ValueA Resident Input
order by ValueA asc;


left join(SortedData)
load
	rowno() as Position,
    ValueB Resident Input
order by ValueB asc;

drop table Input;



//Calculate the delta:
Output:
Load
	fabs(ValueA - ValueB) as Delta
Resident SortedData;

drop table SortedData;
//We could stop here and just use sum(Delta) as a KPI on the frontend.



//Get result as a value in the datamodel
Result:
load sum(Delta) as Result Resident Output
group by;

drop table Output;
