//Import
Input:
LOAD
    @1 as ValueA,
    @2 as ValueB
FROM [lib://AoC/Day1/Input1.txt]
(txt, utf8, no labels, delimiter is spaces, msq); //Lesson Learned: You can not use Order By for csv/txt.



//Get frequency of Values in List B and add it to the Input
left join(Input)
load
	ValueB as ValueA,
    count(ValueB) as Frequency //sum(1) works the same, but might be faster for very, very, very large datasets
Resident Input
group by ValueB;



//Calculate similarity score
Output:
load *, ValueA * Frequency as SimilarityScore resident Input;

drop table Input;
//We could stop here and just use sum(SimilarityScore) as a KPI on the frontend.



//Get result as a value in the datamodel
Result:
load sum(SimilarityScore) as Result Resident Output //to avoid an extra load statement this could have been done as a preceeding load for the Output table.
group by;

drop table Output;
